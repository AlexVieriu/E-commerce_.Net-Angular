5.42. Introduction 
-> sorting
-> filtering
-> searching
-> paging


Pagination:
-> performance
-> parameters passed by query string:
  /api/products?pageNumber=3&pageSize=10  
-> page size should be limited
-> we should always page results

Deferred Execution:
-> when we're building our query, we're not hitting our database, we deferring it until we got the query
-> each part of the query built up as an expression three, and then goes to the database

Steps:
-> query commands are stored in a variable
-> execution of that query will be deferred
-> IQueryable<T> creates an expression three
-> Execution:
    -> ToList(), ToArray(), ToDictionary()
    -> Count() or other singleton queries
