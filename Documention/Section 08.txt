8.63. Introduction 
-> adding components
-> http client module
-> observables
-> Typescript 

Goal:
-> able to use Http client to retrieve data from the API
-> understand the basics of observables and Typescript

8.64. Setting up the folder structure and creating components

-- client -> src -> app -> core --
-> services
-> guards 
-> interceptors


-- -- client -> src -> app -> shared --
-> shared components
-> shared directives
-> shared models

-- -- client -> src -> app -> features --
-> shop
-> shopping cart
-> checkout

-- -- client -> src -> app -> layout --
-> header
-> footer

Open the terminal: 
-> at the end of the terminal we have aliases(snippets) that we will use
cd skinet/client
ng help             
ng generate help 
ng generate component [name] (aliases: ng c [name])
ng generate guard [name] (aliases: ng g guard [name])
ng g c layout/header --dry-run 
    -> creates:
        -> header.component.ts
        -> header.component.html
        -> header.component.spec.ts
        -> header.component.scss
ng g c layout/header --skip-tests
    -> creates 
        -> header.component.ts
        -> header.component.html
        -> header.component.scss

Dictionary:
--dry-run : running the command without actually making any changes to the filesystem

Check to see if the header component is created:
cd skinet/client
ns serve
-> browse to http://localhost:4200/
