7.56. Introduction
-> installing the Angular CLI
-> creating the Angular project
-> setting up VS Code for Angular
-> setting up Angular to use HTTPS
-> Adding Angular Material and Tailwind CSS

Neil Cummings text editors:
-> Rider for .net(JetBrains)
-> WebStorm for Angular, React(JetBrains)

Goal:
-> have a working Angular app running on HTTPS
-> understand angular standalone components and how we use them to build an app

Angular Release Schedule
-> major release every 6 months
-> 1-3 minor releases for each major release
-> a patch release build almost every week 
-> at time of recording Angular is on v18


7.57. Creating the angular project

Check the version compatibility:
https://next.angular.dev/reference/versions

-- Install Node.js: https://joachim8675309.medium.com/installing-node-js-with-nvm-4dc469c977d9 --

# chose desired node version
$version = "23.3.0"
# install nvm w/ cmder
choco install cmder
choco install nvm
refreshenv
# install node
nvm install $version
nvm use $version

-- Install a new Node.js version  --
# chose desired node version
$version = "22.12.0"
# install node
nvm install $version


-- Install angular CLI: https://next.angular.dev/tools/cli/setup-local --
node -v
nmp -v

-- PowerShell --
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
Get-ExecutionPolicy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

-- Install angular version --
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng --version
ng version

-- Install Preview angular version --
npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
npm install -g @angular/cli@next
ng --version


-- Create angular app commands --
ng new client
-> select Sass
-> Enable Server-Side Rendering?: No

-- Check if everything is working --
cd client
ng serve

-> browse to the http://localhost:4200/



Dictionary:
Install the last version of PowerShell: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases
-> look for "Assets" -> PowerShell-7.5.0-rc.1-win-x64.msi

Add "onmyposh" to PowerShell:
https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows  (download oh my posh)
https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/prompt   (configure oh my posh)

Windows PowerShell vs PowerShell vs Visual Studio 2022 Developer PowerShell v17.13.0-pre.1.0
1. Windows PowerShell
-> this is the older, built-in version of PowerShell that comes with Windows.
-> based on the .NET Framework 

2. PowerShell (PowerShell Core)
-> PowerShell 7.x and beyond are the cross-platform, modern versions of PowerShell
-> PowerShell Core (now just called PowerShell) is cross-platform,

3. Visual Studio 2022 Developer PowerShell
-> PowerShell environment that comes integrated into Visual Studio 2022, specifically for developer tasks
-> customized instance of PowerShell that is designed to provide PowerShell support within Visual Studio 
for development tasks, such as managing builds, running scripts, and interacting with the IDE


7.56. Reviewing the Angular project files
-- client -> scr ->  index.html --
<title>Skinet</title>

-- client -> scr -> app -> app.component.ts --
-> in the older version we used modular approach
-> in the newer version we use standalone approach
    -> each component is responsible for importing its own dependencies 

@Component({
    standalone: true,
    ...
})

-- client -> scr -> app -> app.component.html --
-> delete all of the code
<title>Welcome to {{tittle}}</title>

{{tittle}} is from kind of a variable from AppComponent

-> delete the app.component.spec.ts

-- Other important files --
app.config.t
app.routes.ts 
main.ts 
angular.json
package.json 
    -> when we install this packages, they are added into: client-> node_modules
tsconfig.json
    -> "strict": true (strict typescript code)


7.59. Using HTTPS with Angular project 
-> get a self trusted certificate 
https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert

Install on Windows(run as admin):
choco install mkcert

Terminal:
mkcert -install

Create a new certificate for localhost:
cd ..//skinet//client
mkdir ssl
cd ssl
mkcert localhost

To use this certificate, we ned to configure Angular to use them.

-- angular.json --
-> look for "serve" and add :
"options": {
    "ssl": true,
    "sslCert": "ssl/localhost.pem",
    "sslKey": "ssl/localhost-key.pem"
}

-> start the app: cd /client
ng serve
https://localhost:4200/ 

We put https because, when we will use Strips, we will get some errors


-- Best Practices approach --
1. Use a Trusted Certificate for Production
-> always use certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), 
such as Let's Encrypt or commercial providers
-> ensure the certificate includes proper domain names (SANs) and is not just for "localhost."

2. Store Certificates Securely
Development:
a. Secure Directory for Certificates
-> Place your .pem or .pfx files in a directory that is not under source control
or use .gitignore to exclude them
~/ssl/localhost-key.pem
~/ssl/localhost.pem

Even if you later remove the certificate and add it to .gitignore, 
Git tracks the file in the repository history. 
Anyone with access can still retrieve older commits to access the certificate

b. Add an entry in .gitignore
-> client/src/ssl/*

c. Angular Setup
-> Modify your angular.json to point to the local certificate
"serve": {
    "options": {
    "ssl": true,
    "sslCert": "ssl/localhost.pem",
    "sslKey": "ssl/localhost-key.pem"
    }
}

d. Backend Configuration
-> For .NET development, load the certificate locally
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{
    options.Listen(IPAddress.Loopback, 5001, listenOptions =>
    {
        listenOptions.UseHttps("ssl/localhost.pfx", "your-cert-password");
    });
});


Production:
-> store certificates in a dedicated secret management solution 
(e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

-> keep your .pem files in a secure directory outside the source control 
-> use .gitignore to exclude them
ChatGpt: "Give me and example of how to store certificates in a secure way, outside the source control for a .net with Angular project"

a. Upload the Certificate to Azure Key Vault
Export your certificate in .pfx format.
Go to Azure Portal → Key Vault → Certificates → Generate/Import → Import.
Upload your certificate and provide a name.

b. Access Certificate in Your .NET 9 Backend
-> Add the Azure Key Vault NuGet package to your .NET project:
dotnet add package Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets

-> Configure your appsettings.json to include Key Vault settings:
{
  "AzureKeyVault": {
    "VaultUri": "https://<your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net/"
  }
}

-> Retrieve the certificate in your Program.cs or Startup.cs:
builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVault(
    new Uri(builder.Configuration["AzureKeyVault:VaultUri"]),
    new DefaultAzureCredential()
);

var certificateClient = new CertificateClient(
    new Uri(builder.Configuration["AzureKeyVault:VaultUri"]),
    new DefaultAzureCredential()
);

var certificate = certificateClient.GetCertificate("Your-Certificate-Name");
var keyVaultSecret = certificateClient.GetSecret(certificate.Value.SecretId.AbsoluteUri);
var cert = new X509Certificate2(Convert.FromBase64String(keyVaultSecret.Value));

Use the certificate in Kestrel:
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{
    options.Listen(IPAddress.Any, 5001, listenOptions =>
    {
        listenOptions.UseHttps(cert);
    });
});


3. Enable HTTPS for the Backend API
-> your .NET 9 API must also use HTTPS, configure the Kestrel server in appsettings.json
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Https": {
        "Url": "https://localhost:5001",
        "Certificate": {
          "Path": "ssl/localhost.pfx",
          "Password": "your-cert-password"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
-> replace the localhost.pfx with your certificate file and ensure 
the password is securely managed

4. Set Up Angular's Development Server
"serve": {
    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server",
    "options": {
    "ssl": true,
    "sslCert": "ssl/localhost.pem",
    "sslKey": "ssl/localhost-key.pem"
    }}

5. Browser Compatibility
-> add the certificate to the browser’s trusted root certificate store to 
avoid warnings during local development

6. Enforce HTTPS in 
-> using reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or middleware in your .NET app
app.UseHttpsRedirection();

7. Enable HSTS(STTP Strict Transport Security)
app.UseHsts();

8. Secure Communication Between Angular and .NET
-> use relative URLs for API calls in Angular and ensure the Angular app 
communicates with the HTTPS backend only
-> set up CORS in your .NET application to only allow requests from your Angular app's domain

9. CI/CD 
-> for production deployments, automate certificate renewal using tools like 
Certbot(for Let's Encrypt) or through your cloud provider's services

10. Monitoring and Alerts
-> set up monitoring for certificate expiry and HTTPS health using 
tools like Nagios, Pingdom, or cloud-native solutions


60. Adding Angular Material and Tailwind CSS

-- Angular Material --
https://material.angular.io/
cd /skinet/client
ng add @angular/material@next
Yes
Azure/Blue
Global Angular Material Typography: N
Include and Enable animations
cls

-- Tailwind CSS --
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/angular

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init

-> configure the tailwind.config.js file
-> add the tailwind directives to your CSS: ./src/styles.css
  -> delete all the code and replace it with the documentation
  -> to ignore the warning, fo to Settings.json and add:
    -> "scss.lint.unknownAtRules": "ignore"

-- client -> src -> app-> app.component.html --
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">Welcome to {{title}}</h1>

ng serve
