-> where we 'store' the cart
-> adding redis to the API
-> creating a Cart service & controller

Goal:

and create the supporting services and controllers

Where to store the basket?
-> database
-> local storage
-> cookies
-> redis

Redis:
-> in-memory database
-> used for cashing 
-> supports strings, hashes, lists, sets, etc.
-> Key/Value store
-> persists data by using snapshots every minute
-> data can be given time to live
-> great for caching data
