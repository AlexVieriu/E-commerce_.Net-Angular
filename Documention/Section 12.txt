1.104. Introduction

-> where we 'store' the cart
-> adding redis to the API
-> creating a Cart service & controller

Goal:
-> set up/configure Redis to store the customer cart in server memory 
and create the supporting services and controllers

Where to store the basket?
-> database
-> local storage
-> cookies
-> redis

Redis:
-> in-memory database
-> used for cashing 
-> supports strings, hashes, lists, sets, etc.
-> Key/Value store
-> persists data by using snapshots every minute
-> data can be given time to live
-> great for caching data


12.105. Creating a Redis instance 

-- docker-compose.yml --
-> add redis
-> add the volumes for sqlite and redis
-> map the volume from docker to the one in the project

  sqlite:
    image: keinos/sqlite3:latest
    container_name: sqlite3
    command: tail -f /dev/null # Keeps the container running
    volumes:
      - sqlite-data:/data # Persists SQLite data in the local `data` folder
    working_dir: /data
