-> adding the cart feature
-> angular signals
-> environment variables

Goal:
-> add cart features to angular app
-> understand the usage of signals in Angular


13.113. Creating the cart components

ng g s core/services/cart --skip-tests
ng g c features/cart --skip-tests

-- app.routes.ts --
{ path: 'cart', component: CartComponent }

-- header.component.html --
-> add the link to shopping cart
<a routerLink="/cart" routerLinkActive="active"...

echo "" > src/app/shared/models/cartItem.ts
--cartItem.ts--


echo "" > src/app/shared/models/cartType.ts
-- cartType.ts --


echo "" > src/app/shared/models/cart.ts
-- cart.ts --

-> a tiny, secure, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator for JavaScript
-> https://github.com/ai/nanoid
npm install nanoid


Dictionary:
-- Nanoid vs GUID --

Use nanoid when:
-> You need shorter, readable, and customizable IDs
-> You want a lightweight solution without adhering to UUID specifications
-> Performance and efficiency are important (e.g., generating many IDs quickly)
-> The IDs will not need to conform to standardized UUID formats 
(e.g., for APIs expecting GUIDs)

Use GUID when:
-> You require strict adherence to UUID standards (e.g., 
for database keys or APIs that expect GUIDs)
-> Interoperability with other systems or languages that expect UUIDs is necessary
-> The larger size and format aren't a concern
