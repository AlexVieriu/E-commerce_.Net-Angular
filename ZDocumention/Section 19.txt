211. Introduction
-> preparing the app for publishing
-> Angular production build
-> using cloud Redis server
-> publishing to Azure
-> Continuous Integration (CI/CD)
-> troubleshooting Azure 

Free services from Azure:
https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/FreeServicesBlade

-> we will gonna use:
    -> Azure SQL DB
    -> Azure App Service


212. Preparing the client app for publishing

Goal:
-> we need to get our production Angular app
-> out Angular app can be hosted anywhere(but we will use our .net Web Server!!)
-> need to be be hosted by a web Server, because when it gets compile, it will 
get compile into the static Js files and they need to be served from somewhere 
to the Client 

Preparation:

-- angular.json --
"outputPath": {
    "base": "../API/wwwroot",
    "browser": ""
}

-- loading.interceptor.ts --
(environment.production ? identity : delay(500))

-> don't let hardcoded URL(localhost:5150/...), we will have problems in production

ng build 
-> we need to find the wwwroot folder after

Change the Raw size of Angular:

-- angular.json --
"type": "initial",
"maximumWarning": "1.5Mb",
"maximumError": "3MB"
                
ng build 
Output location: F:\Programare\E-commerce_.Net-Angular\skinet\API\wwwroot

-- API -> wwwroot --
main-S6A5GRIC.js
polyfills-FFHMD2TL.js

-> if we build it again will have a different output hash


-- Dictionary --

identity:
-> takes one parameter and returns it
-> it's like a 0ms delay function
