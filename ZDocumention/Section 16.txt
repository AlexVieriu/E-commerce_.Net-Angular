159. Introduction
-> creating a Stripe account
-> PCI DSS Compliance
-> Strong Customer Authentication
-> setting up Payment Intents
-> using Stripe Elements
-> confirming Card payments

Goal: 
-> able to accept payments securely globally that complies with EU regulations and PCI DSS regulations

PCI DSS: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
-> set of industry standards
-> designed to protect payment card data
-> 12 broad requirements and collectively more than 200 line item requirements

6 key requirements:
-> building and maintaining a secure network
-> protecting cardholder data
-> maintaining a vulnerability management program
-> implementing strong access control measures
-> regular monitor and test networks
-> maintaining an information security policy

PCI DSS non-compliance consequences(don't take credit cards directly):
-> monthly financial penalties from 5000$ to 100.000$
-> infringement consequences ($50 to 90$ per card holder whose information has been endangered)
-> compensation costs
-> legal action 
-> damaged reputation
-> revenue loss
-> federal audits

Strong Customer Authentication:
-> EU standards for authenticating online payments
-> Requires 2 of the 3 elements:
    -> something that Customer 
        -> knows (pass or pin)
        -> has (phone or hardware token)
        -> is (fingerprint)
-> Banks will decline payments that require SCA and don't need this criteria
